# doceboVideoSkipper
A simple JS Script to skip videos on course made using the Docebo platform

Works by checking every minute if the video has changed, and adding an event listener for the end of the video that will click on the button to go to the next video.

## How to use
* Go to the course Website.
* Start playing a video from the course.
* Open the console by pressing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `J`.
* Paste the contents of the .js file in the console and press `Enter`.

### Update: You might need to keep the video window visible for the video to keep playing.
